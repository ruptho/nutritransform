# NutriTransform
Deriving nutritional information from online food posts is challenging, particularly when users do not explicitly log the macro-nutrients of a shared meal.
In this work, we present an efficient and straightforward approach to approximating macro-nutrients based solely on the titles of food posts.
Our method combines a public food database from the U.S. Department of Agriculture with advanced text embedding techniques.
